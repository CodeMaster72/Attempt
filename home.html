In the mid 1980's, they saved the video game market with the Nintendo Entertainment System. In 1992, they blew up the industry once again with the SNES, the most powerful console of its time. It was 16 bit, which no other console at its launch was. They followed up with the Nintendo 64, being a console that was capable of 3D, the Gamecube, and 3 more follow up consoles (as of late 2017). Each console made its own records, had its own special and unique features, and all deserve a spot in history.
