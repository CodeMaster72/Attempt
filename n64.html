			<p class="aquaman">Now as of this time, Nintendo was dominating the console market. Virtually, no one could even come close to compete with them and overall had the most powerful consoles. The Sony Playstation changed that in this next generation of console wars. However, that did not stop Nintendo from making their first 64 bit console. Released officially launched on September 29, 1996 in North America, the machine had a 64-bit R4300i RISC CPU running at about 93.75MHz and a 64-bit RISC co-processor clocking in at around 62.5MHz. Another little fact is the co-processor had a Pixel Drawing Processor built in it, which contributed towards it's graphics. In addition, the N64 had 4MB (36Mb) of RAM which was actually upgradeable on the consumers end. When it comes to it's capabilities, it really put up a fight. It could display 16.7 million different colors, 32,000 of which were on screen. It could also render 150,000 polygons per second, at a 640x480p resolution. If this doesn't sound good, the audio output was 16 to 24-channel 16-bit stereo, all improvements to the previous model. After all the dust settled, there were 20.64 million units sold across the Americas, and 32.92 million units worldwide. These sales were less than the SNES and barely over the NES sales.</p>
