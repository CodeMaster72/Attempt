			<p class="aquaman">Nintendo at this point in time was always known for being innovative and having new ideas, but the lack of sales in the recent consoles was a huge blow. Their next console had to be a game changer and bring as many new elements as possible. On November 19, 2006, Nintendo did just that with the release of the Wii. The Wii wasn't that powerful, but with it's immense amount of Gamecube support and intuitive motion controls, it was a sight to behold. The system had a PowerPC-based Broadway processor running at about 729 MHz and a ATI Hollywood GPU clocked around 243 MHz. The thing about the output is it supported widescreen and standard 4:3 displays. The Wii was only slightly more powerful than the Gamecube, was the way it was marketed and the ideas of the console didn't need it to be that powerful. In the grand scheme of things, it was the most sold console and the weakest of this generation. The Wii overall sold 101.52 million units of all time, which is more than all the previous consoles and was very successful overall. Now all Nintendo needed to do was just keep up this success....</p>
