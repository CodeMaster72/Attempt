			<p class="aquaman">Now the console is only 9 months old as of the creation of this page and has made many improvemnts and changes to the video game industry. The Nintendo Switch is able to be either played on the big TV or on the go, where ever. The Switch has just hit 10 million units as of December 2017, which is slightly less than what the Wii U did in it's entire lifetime. Now, like the Wii U, the specs are hard to pinpoint and figure out, but we do know it uses the NVIDIA Custom Tegra processor, which is speculated to run at 1020MHz regardless of whether the console is docked or undocked. Every other piece of information is unknown or debated but one thing is certain; the Switch is a heavy hitter right now. It already has a great library of game and made people over the world eager to get one. Long term progress? Unknown to say this early. But from the looks of it, this thing can be a revolution in the world of gaming, just like the NES. </p>
