			<p class="aquaman">The Gamecube was ambitious and was supposed to bring back the Nintendo name to households like it did in the past. Unfortunately, the Playstation 2 crushed those hopes and even put an entire company out of the console wars. The Gamecube was released on November 18, 2001 in North America but still overshadowed by the launch of the PS2. The Gamecube's CPU was a powerful 128-bit custom IBM Gekko PowerPC clocked at 485MHz. This console actually was Nintendo's first to have a GPU, being an ATI Flipper at 162MHz. With all this power comes some great performance. The Gamecube was capable of 16.7 million colors on screen, rendered 20 million polygons per second, and was all displaying at a maxed 480p resoultion. The console also finally moved away from cartridges, but used an 1.5GB 8cm optical disk, which is smaller and held less space than regular disks. In addition, you were listening to it's 16-bit Macronix DSP Sound Processor that produced 64 voices. Sales wise, out of all the other consoles on the market, it sold the least with only 22 million units worldwide. </p>
