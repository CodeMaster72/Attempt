			<p class="aquaman"> To really understand the Nintendo Entertainment System's story, we need to go back to the year 1983. In the United States, the video game market had crashed. Most consoles had a reputation for losing money and being a trend that was passing. Nintendo before this time made 3rd party arcade games and smaller forms of gaming entertainment, such as cards or basic handhelds. The NES has a 8-bit 6502 NMOS CPU that clocks in at 1.79 MHz, 2K of RAM, (16Kb), and used PSG audio. It was able to display 52 colors (24 on screen) and 64 sprites that can be maximized at 8x16 pixels. The resolution was 256x240 or 240p and all of this was quite impressive for it's time. It was release in 1986 in the USA and came with 2 different sets; an Arcade set and a Deluxe set, retailing at 199 and 249 USD. By 1987, Nintendo had a 90% grasp on the console market and in 4 years, it sold 30 million units. </p>
