			<p class="aquaman"> The NES was doing so well, there was no rush for a new console from Nintendo. While during the lifetime of the NES, there were 16 bit consoles. They still never met the height of the NES, such as the Sega Master System and the TurboGrafx-16. On August 23, 1991 in North America, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System was released. The Super in the title was to signify power and it did just that. Compared to the other consoles of the period, it beat them graphically and in the audio department. This 16 bit beast was running with a Custom 65C816 at 3.58 MHz as it's CPU and it had 128 Kb of RAM. It could output at 256x224 with 256 colors on screen and 128 sprites (32 per scanline). When it came to it's audio, there were 8 ADPCM sound channels with 64 Kb of allocated sound memory. This console released at a retail price of 199 USD, but unlike the NES, there were no special bundles or toys included. The SNES went on to sell 20 million units in the U.S. and 49.10 million worldwide.</p>
