			<p class="aquaman">Nintendo's jump into the High Definition age wasn't that smooth. The Wii U was marketed so poorly and it was explained as if it was an add-on to the Wii, which we now know it isn't. The 3rd party support was lacking and barely any companies provided games towards the console. On the bright side, the Wii U was more powerful than the last generation, but slightly less powerful than the rest of the current generation. The Wii U was released on November 18, 2012, did well on launch and that was as best as the console seen. This console actually has it's specs on the Nintendo website. Unfortunately the actual numbers are not released or specified so it is unknown how it actually runs or how much it actually can be capable of. In the bigger picture, the console didn't do that well and let down a lot of people and fans. As of late 2017, the console has sold 13.56 million units worldwide, which is the lowest number of any of the consoles ever produced by Nintendo.</p>
